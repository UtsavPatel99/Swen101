        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm just your average person who went to Streetsboro High School. I always had a knack for writing and a curiosity about tech stuff. Now I'm off to college to study Software Engineering, which is pretty cool, I guess. When I'm not hitting the books, you'll find me out in nature, gaming and playing the guitar like there's no tomorrow. I'm also big on giving back to the community, volunteering at local shelters, and getting involved in charity work. Life's a journey, and I'm all about taking it as it comes!
